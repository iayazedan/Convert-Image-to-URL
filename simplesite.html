  <h1>Simple Site</h1>

  <h3>Summary:</h3>

  <p><img id="img-1" alt="Sun2" style="float:right;width:150px;margin:15px;"/>

  The is a simple website to demonstrate how to add dataURI's to your website which is setup manually.  Normally I like to use the templated html approach since it helps

  to keep the pages looking better organized which improves it's maintainability.  But I thought it would be useful to have an example of how to implement the use of 

  DataURIs on a simple site where the developer goes in and manually positions the images.  The "MyImages" page HTML was completely built programmatically and then passed to the

  html file with the DOM ready event function.

  <h3>Description</h3>

  <p>

  <img id="img-2" alt="Sun3" style="float:left;width:150px;margin:15px;" />This simple site is part of a 3 page Google WebApp which demonstrates how to make and store

  images as dataURI's so that you can utilize your Google Account for storing images rather than requiring another site to host your images. The main page is a tool for 

  converting images from a known URL to dataURIs and storing them on your Google Drive.  The file ids are collected and store in a spreadsheet for distribution to other projects

  as needed the simplicity of getting images in this way save the developer from having to find a place to host images outside of Google.  To use images of your own all you need to

  do is upload them to Google Photo Library. You can take those images which have already been sized by you photo editor and converted to dataURIs and store them on your Google.  

  This function is performed with a very simple Javascript function utilizing the Google Apps Script to return the URI via the withSuccessHandler() 

  which places it into the source of the image with a simple JQuery command.  You can view that right now with your browser developer tools.

  <h3>From Your Personal Computer to Your Website</h3>

  <p><img id="img-3" style="float:right;width:700px;margin-left:15px;" />This is a chart made with Draw.IO Diagrams which is a great tool.  It highlights some of the steps in getting images from your pc to your website using DataURI's it also

  contains some of the Javascript and Google Apps Script which is used along the way. This image was generated by Data.IO Diagrams export tools. It was then downloaded to a 

  computer and then uploaded to Google Photo Library. From the libary it was easy to get the URL and paste it into the Image Converter and save on the Google Drive as a DataURI.  

  I have found the conversion quality to be quite good.
